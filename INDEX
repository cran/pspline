Pspline by Jim Ramsay, 1996/11/26
=================================

predict.smooth.Pspline   Smoothing spline of arbitrary order at new data
smooth.Pspline           Fit a polynomial smoothing spline of arbitrary
                         order

sm.spline		 Interface to smooth.Pspline like smooth.spline

As smooth.Pspline requires x to be supplied in increasing order with no
ties, sm.spline tries to convert the data to that form and to select method
automatically.
