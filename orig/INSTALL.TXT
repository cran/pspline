Here are some notes on the installation process.  But read Makefile before
installation since it contains detailed installation notes.   

1.  The procedure described in Chapter 11 of the Programmers Manual
distributed with Splus (see Statistical Sciences, 1993) were followed to 
set up the  following files:

README.TXT    ...  this file contains an overview of the Pspline
                   module and descriptions of each of the functions
INSTALL.TXT    ...  this is what you are reading now
Pspline.a     ...  the Splus code that calls the Fortran Version
Pspline.f     ...  the Fortran code called by the Splus function Pspline
smooth.Pspline.d  ...  a troff file to set up the help display for 
                   function smooth.Pspline
predict.smooth.Pspline.d  ...  a troff file to set up the help display for
                   function predict.smooth.Pspline

These were bundled together with the shar utility by the statement

shar -o Pspline -n Pspline -a -c README.TXT INSTALL.TXT Pspline.q  
        Pspline.f smooth.Pspline.d predict.smooth.Pspline.d 

2.  The above files can be extracted by

sh Pspline.01
 
3.  A Makefile can then be created by the command

Splus CHAPTER Pspline.q Pspline.f smooth.Pspline.d predict.smooth.Pspline.d

or

Splus CHAPTER *.q *.f *.d

followed by  

make install

and

make

Note that the Makefile can be altered for dynamic loading prior to invoking 
make install.  

4.  Note that the Splus functions smooth.Pspline and predict.smooth.Pspline
currently call the .Fortran interface to Fortran.  If a C version of
Pspline.f is produced by, for example, using the f2c conversion utility, 
these calls should be replaced to the .C versions.
Then the Makefile should be reconstructed by using the command

Splus CHAPTER Pspline.q Pspline.c smooth.Pspline.d predict.smooth.Pspline.d

5.  A little something that they never tell you ... don't use a period
or other special character in the name of the directory where you install
Pspline.  If you call Splus CHAPTER filenames to reconstruct Makefile, 
it will bomb.

6.  Makefile is currently set up to have Pspline dynamically loaded by
calling dyn.load or dyn.load2.  There is a counterpart statement 
WHICH_LOAD=static.load at the top of the file that can be used to make a 
statically loaded local version.  Remove # from this statement and place it 
in front of WHICH_LOAD=dyn.load if this is what you desire.
